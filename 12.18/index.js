/*
ðŸ˜± Christmas can get expensive! 

You've been on a shopping trip and spent too much money. 
But how much of that can you blame on Christmas?

**Task**

- Calculate and return the total cost of only the gifts in the shopping cart.
- Each gift has the isGift boolean set to true.
- The total cost of gifts should be given to two decimal places.

Expected output: 559.93  

**Stretch Goal**

- Use the reduce() method to complete this challenge.

    const cost = arr.filter(item => item.isGift).reduce((acc, c) => acc += c.price, 0);

    return Number(cost).toFixed(2);
}

console.log(calculateCost(shoppingCartData)) //559.93
